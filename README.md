- Visualization: to tell and present the story

**Potential visualizations**
- Map of supply chain of various goods
- Export / import from various countries / regions
- Amount shipped over time(by lane / port / commodity)
- Average length of shipping routes over time
- Port congestions during and outside of crisis
- Port congestions vs commodity prices
- Size of ships over time and forecasts (for fun)
- Largest companies and their fleet sizes?
- What happened during the Suez Canal crisis?
